# vim-conceal-cpp
Render ligatures in place of some operators with vim conceal. 

Replaces a few operators in c++ with unicode symbols in *vim. This plugin is for minimal replacements similar to what a font with ligatures would do. For more replacements, consider using [this](https://github.com/LawrencePeng/vim-cute-cpp) plugin instead.

## Replaced Operators
++, ==, !=, <=, >=, <<, >>, ::, ->, ||

## Installation

Place cpp.vim into ~/.vim/after/syntax or ~/.config/nvim/after/syntax or use a plugin manager.
